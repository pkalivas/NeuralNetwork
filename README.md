# NeuralNetwork
Neural Network object

Simple feed forward neural network object. Capable of basic feed-forward and backpropagating. 
Two activation functions (sigmoid, relu) are given as options to use. Script irisGetter.py will download the iris flower dataset, clean and split the data, then put it in a file called irisdata (you might have to make this folder). This data can then be used to test or play with the network.

Built to learn how neural nets work.
